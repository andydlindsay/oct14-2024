# W02D01 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [x] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] What is TDD?

### Testing
* manual testing

### Making Assertions
* assertion: forceful statement of fact or belief
* want to see an error on failure

### Node
* what is Node?
* javascript interpreter
* Chrome V8 engine
* wrapped it in C++
* a couple dozen extra optional packages that we can use/opt into

### Test Runner
* piece of software that auto runs your tests
* fast!!!!
* Mocha, Jest, Cucumber

### Downloading Packages
* package manager
* NPM, Yarn, PNPM

```bash
npm install package-name # as a dependency of our project
npm install --save-dev package-name # saved as a dev dependency
npm install -g package-name # saves globally on your OS
```

### What is TDD?
* Test-driven development
* tests are written before the code
