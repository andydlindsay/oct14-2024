### Responsive Design
* looks good and works well on a variety of devices

### Media Query
* asks questions about the device
* media features: height, width, orientation
* media types: screen, print, speech

### Preprocessors and Supersets
* something that processes your code before the browser does
* Sass, Stylus, Less => preprocessor turns it into css
* superset => a programming language that wraps another one
* Sassy CSS => SCSS .scss .sass
